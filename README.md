# ImageClassifier--DogCat
This repository contains beginner/intermediate level image classification project files. The classifier is implemented in a webapp that can also be deployed on Pivotal Web Services using cloudfoundry cli.
<br>
The classifier model was trained using 25000 images of cats and dogs available on kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats
<br>
I have used various image classification algorithms starting with the most basic cnn ones(with/without augmentations) to see how the performance improves.

Note : This project was done in PyCharm and during my Deep Learning and Computer Vision Course at iNeuron.
